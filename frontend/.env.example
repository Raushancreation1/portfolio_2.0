# Frontend environment variables
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT store secret API keys in the frontend. Anything in Vite `.env` files
# that starts with VITE_ will be exposed to the browser. Move AI keys to backend/.env
# and access them server-side only.

# For local development, you can leave this unset to rely on Vite's dev proxy
# configured in `frontend/vite.config.js`. For production builds, set this to your
# deployed backend URL (without a trailing slash), e.g.:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
